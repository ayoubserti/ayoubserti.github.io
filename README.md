## Welcome to Ayoub Serti Page

I'm Ayoub Serti, I'm senior C++ developer and JavaScript fun. I use to combine C++ with Javascript to make awesome things. You may find in my Github [Github](https://github.com/ayoubserti/) helpful tools and library such as [node-iohook](https://github.com/ayoubserti/node-iohook) which is a complete NodeJS module to catch-up events triggered by mouse and keyboard.

In [minimal-node](https://github.com/ayoubserti/minimal-node) I try to introduce how NodeJS works by recreating the wheel; In fact, this repository dig deeper in NodeJS implementation and reproduce some useful concept as ( stream, process.nextTick, timers and Filesystem ). In another hand, it help developer to master how NodeJS works by isolating every concept in a unique branch.
